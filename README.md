## About

This repo is a collection of projects covering key topics in Python and programming, including:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Object-oriented programming
- Test-driven development
- Error and exception handling
- File I/O
- Modules and imports
- More advanced Python features

Each project is organized in its own directory and includes scripts, modules, and (where applicable) tests and documentation.

## Repository Structure

The main directories in this repository include:

- **python-hello_world/**: Introduction to Python basics and syntax.
- **python-if_else_loops_functions/**: Loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **python-import_modules/**: Working with modules and imports.
- **python-data_structures/**: Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- **python-more_data_structures/**: Advanced data structures techniques.
- **python-exceptions/**: Exception handling in Python.
- **python-test_driven_development/**: Test-driven development and doctest.
- will update when new directories are added... For now, GFY, nah Jk, love u bro. 

Each directory contains its own README or documentation, Python scripts, and sometimes test files.
